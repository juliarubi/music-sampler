<h1>Taylor Swift</h1>

<p id="one">Taylor Allison Swift was born December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. She is a 31-year-old singer-songwriter who has transitioned from country songstress to pop super star over her successful career. In Pennsylvania, her family owned a Christmas tree farm. Growing up, she sang at various shows and events, including her performance of the “Star Spangled Banner” at a 76ers basketball game. When she was 14, her family moved to Nashville, Tennessee to allow her to pursue her music career. There she signed to Big Machine Records under Scott Borchetta.</p>

<p id="two"> Under Big Machine Records, Taylor went on to release 6 studio albums. These include Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, and Reputation. She has won many different awards for these works, including Album of the Year for Fearless and 1989. Within this time, she made a total genre shift from country to pop music starting with 1989. Taylor ended up leaving Big Machine Records, when Scott Borchetta refused to sell her ownership of her records. Taylor’s music was subsequently sold to Scooter Braun.</p>

<p id="three">Taylor then signed with a new record, Republic Records. Under this label, she would own her music upon release. She has released 3 original albums with Republic Records: Lover, Folklore, and Evermore. All of which were released over the span of two years. She was awarded Album of the Year for Folklore, making her the first woman in history to win three times. Taylor also decided to pursue re-recording her first 6 studio albums, of which she has already released two (Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and Red (Taylor’s Version)). These re-recorded albums include all the original tracks, plus “Vault” tracks. These re-recordings are strongly supported by her label and her fans.</p>
